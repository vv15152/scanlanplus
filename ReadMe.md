This is a simple network scanner built using Python3. You can find open ports and vulnerabilities in the network to which the scanning device is connected to.
Works perfectly on Windows as well as Linus environments.
Just make sure you have Nmap installed on the system (Ignore, you pentesters!)

This extended version of scanlan gives you advanced information regarding the devices in the local network like programs installed, their version, OS information etc. 
while eating up some time. (Expect longer scanning times)

How to Use?
